The data for this model can be found at https://https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

The data was analyzed using the sklearn: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradiant Boosting, Gaussian, LDA, and QDA Classifiers. All models achieved relatively high recall of roughly 80% or higher. Adaboost and GradientBoosting Classifiers both had the highest AUC ROCs of roughly 0.90 and recalls of roughly 87%, but were significantly less precise than the KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifiers.
