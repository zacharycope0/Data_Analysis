# Caravan_Insurance

This folder shows the steps that I used to build a model for predicting whether a customer has mobile home insurance. The target variable is imbalanced with only 6% of customers having mobile home plans.

Initial run and visualizations of attributes can be seen in CaravanPred1&Visual_NoDataCleaning.ipynb

My final model can be found in FINALCaravanPred4_OversamplingA. Using LDA I was able to achieve a ROC AUC of 67%,Â  recall of 65%, and accuracy of 69%.
